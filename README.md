Common_Overlay
==============

Plugin for overlay - lightweight

Plugin for invoking modal window, it is lightweight and works cross browser. Has very minimal but useful features for those who like to invoke content via ajax or inline and need only few features.

Uses no image, jquery dependent and inspired from http://fancybox.net/, though not all features were required hence recreated it.

There are lot of jquery modal/overlay plugins out there, but this comes as 1Kb(yes, it is) minified JS file.

So go ahead and enjoy.
